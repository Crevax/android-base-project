    <string name="demo_welcome_message">Welcome to the demo portion of this base application! It\'s
        a simple showcase of the app\'s architecture. Enter a message below and a toast will appear
        with the message printed in reverse. The ViewModel backs the input text, so it will be
        preserved on orientation changes. The text reversal is to demonstrate Dependency Injection
        through Dagger2 by providing an interface implementation that is responsible for the
        operation.
